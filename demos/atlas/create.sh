# This script builds an "atlas" of world APIs, drawing on API descriptions in
# a variety of formats and from a variety of sources.

# It assumes an environment configured to call a Registry API implementation.
# This includes the registry-server running with a local SQLite database,
# which can be started by running `registry-server -c config/sqlite.yaml`
# from the root of the registry repo. To configure clients to call this
# server, run `source auth/LOCAL.sh` in the shell before running the following
# commands.

# First, delete the "atlas" project to get a fresh start.
apg admin delete-project --name projects/atlas

# Now create the atlas project.
apg admin create-project \
	--project_id atlas \
	--project.display_name "Atlas" \
	--project.description "APIs collected from around the world"
