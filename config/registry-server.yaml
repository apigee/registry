# This configuration file uses environment variables to configure the registry
# server. Environment variable names are arbitrary and can be changed to any
# user-preferred values. Environment variable references can also be replaced
# with specific values. For example, "${PORT}" could be replaced with "8080"
# to specify a specific port or changed to "${REGISTRY_PORT}" to refer to the
# REGISTRY_PORT environment variable. Here we use PORT instead of REGISTRY_PORT
# because PORT is the variable passed in by Google Cloud Run to configure hosted
# services.

# Port where the server will listen.
# If unset or zero, an open port will be assigned.
