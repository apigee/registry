      description: Forces a task to run now. When this method is called, Cloud Tasks will dispatch the task, even if the task is already running, the queue has reached its RateLimits or is PAUSED. This command is meant to be used for manual debugging. For example, RunTask can be used to retry a failed task after a fix has been made or to manually force a task to be dispatched now. The dispatched task is returned. That is, the task that is returned contains the status after the task is dispatched but before the task is received by its target. If Cloud Tasks receives a successful response from the task's target, then the task will be deleted; otherwise the task's schedule_time will be reset to the time that RunTask was called plus the retry delay specified in the queue's RetryConfig. RunTask returns NOT_FOUND when it is called on a task that has already succeeded or permanently failed. RunTask cannot be called on a pull task.

      description: "App Engine HTTP request. The message defines the HTTP request that is sent to an App Engine app when the task is dispatched. This proto can only be used for tasks in a queue which has app_engine_http_target set. Using AppEngineHttpRequest requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same project as the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed) and how routing is affected by [dispatch files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref). Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters. Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS). The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level: * If set, app_engine_routing_override is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is: * `url =` host `+` relative_url Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login: admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`login: required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref) Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response code in the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response before the deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the retry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system error instead of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches. Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue."

This header can be modified, but Cloud Tasks will append `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the modified `User-Agent`. If the task has a payload, Cloud Tasks sets the following headers: * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to `"application/octet-stream"`.

For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`. * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is output only. It cannot be changed. The headers below cannot be set or overridden: * `Host` * `X-Google-*` * `X-AppEngine-*` In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task is dispatched, such as headers containing information about the task; see [request headers](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/push/creating-handlers#reading_request_headers). These headers are set only when the task is dispatched, so they are not visible when the task is returned in a Cloud Tasks response.

If schedule_time is not set or is in the past then Cloud Tasks will set it to the current time. Task De-duplication: Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication. If a task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task that was deleted or completed recently then the call will fail with ALREADY_EXISTS. If the task's queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~1hour after the original task was deleted or completed. If the task's queue was created using queue.yaml or queue.xml, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~9days after the original task was deleted or completed. Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names, these CreateTask calls have significantly increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in all task commands. The infrastructure relies on an approximately uniform distribution of task ids to store and serve tasks efficiently."

    Policy:
      description: "An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/)."

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost."

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second. "
