Some web tooling (like mock servers, real servers, code generators, application frameworks, etc.) will treat example.com/foo and example.com/foo/ as the same thing, but other tooling will not. Avoid any confusion by just documenting them without the slash, and maybe some tooling will let people shove a / on there when they're using it or maybe not, but at least the docs are suggesting how it should be done properly.
