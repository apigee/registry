# apg

`apg` is a command-line interface for the Registry API that is automatically
generated by [tools/GENERATE-APG.sh](/tools/GENERATE-APG.sh) using
[protoc-gen-go_cli](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-go/tree/main/cmd/protoc-gen-go_cli).
Every method of the Registry API is supported. Higher-level abstractions and
utilities are in the handwritten [registry](/cmd/registry) tool.

## Usage

Run `apg help` for general information and `apg registry help` for a list of
supported API operations.

## Configuration

`apg` is configured with environment variables that are set by authorization
scripts in the [auth](/auth) directory of this project. This includes the
address of the Registry API server and authentication tokens.
